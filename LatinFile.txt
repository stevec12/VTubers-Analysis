This was a game of quick thinking and cleverness; skills that you displayed well. Like when you jumped and hid on top of that castle, luring away the zombies from everybody else. Nice job looping the cop when they tried to climb up there. I loved the idea of you then hiding by a fence. Because if a cop showed up you could high jump the fence, but they could not lol. Ah, and I think it was so cute how you went off to a corner away from everybody else. Your shyness is really cute Peko-chan  This was very fun!
